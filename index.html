            <h3>Interactive Liquid Splash Modeling by User Sketches</h3>
            <p> Splashing is one of the most fascinating liquid phenomena in the real world and it is favored by artists to create stunning visual effects, both statically and dynamically. Unfortunately, the generation of complex and specialized liquid splashes is a challenging task and often requires considerable time and effort. In this paper, we present a novel system that synthesizes realistic liquid splashes from simple user sketch input. Our system adopts a conditional generative adversarial network (cGAN) trained with physics-based simulation data to produce raw liquid splash models from input sketches, and then applies model refinement processes to further improve their small-scale details. The system considers not only the trajectory of every user stroke, but also its speed, which makes the splash model simulation-ready with its underlying 3D flow. Compared with simulation-based modeling techniques through trials and errors, our system offers flexibility, convenience, and intuition in liquid splash design and editing. We evaluate the usability and the efficiency of our system in an immersive virtual reality environment. Thanks to this system, an amateur user can now generate a variety of realistic liquid splashes in just a few minutes. </p>

            <h3>Inexact Descent Methods for Elastic Parameter Optimization</h3>
            <p> Elastic parameter optimization has revealed its importance in 3D modeling, virtual reality, and additive manufacturing in recent years. Unfortunately, it is known to be computationally expensive, especially if there are many parameters and data samples. To address this challenge, we propose to introduce the inexactness into descent methods, by iteratively solving a forward simulation step and a parameter update step in an inexact manner. The development of such inexact descent methods is centered at two questions: 1) how accurate/inaccurate can the two steps be; and 2) what is the optimal way to implement an inexact descent method. The answers to these questions are in our convergence analysis, which proves the existence of relative error thresholds for the two inexact steps to ensure the convergence. This means we can simply solve each step by a fixed number of iterations, if the iterative solver is at least linearly convergent. While the use of the inexact idea speeds up many descent methods, we specifically favor a GPU-based one powered by state-of-the-art simulation techniques. Based on this method, we study a variety of implementation issues, including backtracking line search, initialization, regularization, and multiple data samples. We demonstrate the use of our inexact method in elasticity measurement and design applications. Our experiment shows the method is fast, reliable, memory-efficient, GPU friendly, flexible with different elastic models, scalable to a large parameter space, and parallelizable for multiple data samples.</p>

            <h3>Cloth Simulation</h3>
            <p> Clothes simulation has been an important area of research in computer graphics for its wide applications, for example, in the fashion industry. Simulation techniques, for example, the position-based/projective dynamics and the multigrid method cab be used because they are proven to be fast and stable, which makes it possible for real-time applications. Another key part for clothes simulation is the handling of the collisions and contacts. This includes clothes self-collisions, like different parts of the clothes may intersect with each other and the also contact between clothes and the virtual human body...</p><p><a href="./resources/cloth.mp4">Real-time demo...</a></p>

        	<h3>Hyperelasticity: FEM Simulation</h3>
            <p> Creating believable and compelling character motions is the central challenge in animated movie productions. Manually rigging a character for each animation keyframe is tedious and time consuming. On the other hand, physics-based simulation excel at creating such realistic effects, such as the simulation of secondary motion, but are inherently difficult to control. Rig-Space Physics unifies keyframing and physical simulation by creating an underlying representation of the character based on an elastic deformable material and formulating the equations of motions in the subspace of deformations defined by an animator’s rig. </p> <p><a href="./resources/ball.mp4">Rig-space FEM: bouncing ball...</a></p>

            <p> The Finite Element Method has been very popular in the simulation of deformable elastic solids. The neo-Hookean model is a hyperelastic material model that can be used for predicting the nonlinear stress-strain behavior of materials undergoing large deformations. For example, it is usable for rubber-like substances and biological materials. The energy function is deined via principle stretches, which is isotropic and invertible.</p> <p><a href="./resources/elephant.mp4">Real-time demo: walking elephant...</a></p>

        	<h3>G.E.M: geometry modeling</h3>
            <p> G.E.M. is a lightweight 3D geometry modeling tool. It is very convenient for Curve Modeling, Basic Geometric Models Generation, Surface Modeling and Curve reconstruction. For curve modeling, you can generate Bezier curve, Cubic B-spline or Quadric B-spline. And then you can construct basic geometric models through operations like revolution, extrusion, sweeping and lofting. For Surface Modeling, besides the basic Bezier surface and B-spline surface, more general subdivision surfaces like Doo-Sabin surface, Catmull-Clark surface or Loop surface are also supported. 2D Curve reconstruction is implemented using Nearest Neighor Algorithm and Crust Algorithm.
